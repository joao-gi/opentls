"""Key Derivation Functions module.

 - pbkdf2(password, length, salt=None, iterations=1000):
    Uses PBKDF2 to generate a Secret object that includes the derived key. If
    salt is None a random salt of 8 bytes will be generated using the
    tls.random module.

Secret objects, which represented shared secrets, are named tuples with the
following properties.

 - key:        The derived key.
 - salt:       The salt used to seed the key derivation function.
 - iterations: The number of iterations used when deriving the key.
